## üîÆ Vision

LOAR revolutionizes narrative creation by putting the power of storytelling in the hands of communities. Our platform enables collaborative cinematic universe development with decentralized governance, censorship-resistant content hosting, and blockchain-based ownership.

## üöÄ Core Features

### üß© Narrative Flow Editor
- **Interactive Graph-Based Editor** - Create and visualize complex narrative structures
- **Character-Plot Connections** - Link characters to storylines with visual relationships
- **Canonicity Management** - Track and vote on official universe canon
- **NFT Integration** - Characters backed by NFT ownership

### üõ°Ô∏è Censorship-Resistant Content (Powered by Walrus Protocol)
- **Decentralized Video Storage** - Content that can't be taken down or censored
- **Blockchain Certification** - Videos certified on Sui blockchain
- **Guaranteed Availability** - Content remains accessible regardless of platform pressure
- **Trustless Distribution** - No central authority controls your narrative

### üñºÔ∏è NFT Character System (OpenSea Integration)
- **Automatic Character Generation** - Create character profiles from NFT metadata
- **MCP Server Integration** - Direct access to OpenSea's Multi-Chain Protocol
- **Rarity-Based Attributes** - Character traits influenced by NFT rarity
- **Dynamic Wikis** - Auto-generated character wikis from NFT collections

### üèõÔ∏è Decentralized Governance
- **Token-Based Voting** - Community decides on canonical content
- **Proposal System** - Submit narrative elements for community approval
- **Stake-Weighted Influence** - Greater stake means greater say in universe direction
- **Transparent Decision Making** - All votes recorded on-chain

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Bun** (recommended) - [Install here](https://bun.sh/)
- **PostgreSQL** - [Install here](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- **Foundry** (for smart contracts) - [Install here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- **Ethereum wallet** (MetaMask recommended)
- **NFT holdings** (for full governance participation)

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd Loar-Fullstack
   ```

<<<<<<< HEAD
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   # Install dependencies for the entire monorepo
   bun install
   
   # If you encounter missing dependencies, install them specifically for the web app
   cd apps/web
   bun install
   bun add reactflow  # Required for the narrative flow editor
   ```

3. **Set up Dynamic Wallet Authentication:**
   - Go to [Dynamic Dashboard](https://app.dynamic.xyz/)
   - Create a new project
   - Copy your Environment ID
   - Create `.env` file in `apps/web/`:
     ```env
     VITE_DYNAMIC_ENVIRONMENT_ID=your_environment_id_here
     VITE_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

4. **Configure your environment:**
   - Update `apps/server/.env` with your PostgreSQL and OpenSea API details
   - Copy `apps/web/.env.example` to `apps/web/.env` and update as needed

5. **Set up the database:**
   ```bash
   # From the root directory
   bun db:push
   # Or if you prefer to run migrations
   cd apps/server
   bun run db:generate
   bun run db:migrate
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

1. **Launch the platform:**
   ```bash
   # Run the full stack:
   bun dev
   
   # Or run just the frontend:
   bun dev:web
   
   # Or run just the backend:
   bun dev:server
   ```

2. **Access the application:**
   - Web App: [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) or [http://localhost:3002](http://localhost:3002) (port may vary if 3001 is already in use)
   - API endpoints: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter dependency issues:

1. **Missing packages**: Some dependencies might not be installed automatically. If you see errors about missing packages, install them individually:
   ```bash
   cd apps/web
   bun add reactflow @tailwindcss/postcss autoprefixer
   ```

2. **Port conflicts**: If port 3001 is already in use, the application will automatically use port 3002 or another available port.

3. **Database connection issues**: Ensure PostgreSQL is running and your connection details in `apps/server/.env` are correct.

4. **Workspace warnings**: You may see warnings about missing workspace directories like "packages/" or "contracts/". These can be safely ignored if you're only working on the web and server applications.

3. **Deploy smart contracts (optional):**
   ```bash
   cd apps/contracts
   forge build
   forge test
   ```

## üåê Access the Application

## üåü Why LOAR? (For Hackathon Judges)

### üí° The Problem We're Solving
Traditional media creation is centralized, controlled by studios and platforms that can censor content, restrict creator freedom, and limit community involvement. When communities do participate, there's no reliable way to track canonical content or ensure fair governance.

### üõ†Ô∏è Our Solution
LOAR creates a decentralized ecosystem where:

1. **Communities Own Their Narratives** - Not corporations or platforms
2. **Content Cannot Be Censored** - Thanks to Walrus Protocol's decentralized storage
3. **Ownership Is Verifiable** - Through blockchain authentication and NFTs
4. **Governance Is Democratic** - With on-chain voting and proposals
5. **Creation Is Collaborative** - With our visual narrative flow editor

### üí∏ Market Potential
- **$300B+** global entertainment market
- **80M+** NFT owners seeking utility for their digital assets
- **Growing demand** for decentralized content platforms resistant to censorship
- **Expanding creator economy** looking for new monetization models

### üìä Technical Innovation
1. **First-of-its-kind integration** between narrative creation tools and decentralized storage
2. **Novel use of OpenSea MCP** for character generation from NFT metadata
3. **Unique visual editor** for managing narrative canonicity with blockchain verification
4. **Censorship-resistant media pipeline** from creation to distribution

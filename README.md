# LOAR: Decentralized Narrative Control System

**LOAR** is a revolutionary platform for decentralized narrative control in collaborative content cinematic universes. We're redefining how canonical content is determined through blockchain-powered consensus mechanisms and NFT ownership.

## 🚀 Core Features

- **NFT-Powered Canon Control** - OpenSea NFT integration determines narrative authority and voting power
- **Decentralized Character Wikis** - Community-built lore with ownership verification
- **Tokenomics Governance** - Token-weighted voting on canonical storylines and character development
- **Blockchain Authentication** - Secure wallet-based authentication system
- **Decentralized Video Storage** - Walrus protocol integration for distributed content hosting
- **Dynamic Content Markets** - Create, trade, and monetize narrative elements
- **Cross-Universe Collaboration** - Build interconnected stories across multiple creator universes

## 💎 Why LOAR?

In the expanding multiverse of collaborative content creation, determining what's "canon" has always been centralized and contentious. LOAR disrupts this paradigm by creating a decentralized consensus mechanism where narrative control is determined by community ownership, engagement, and tokenized governance.

## 🔮 Getting Started
### Prerequisites

- Ethereum wallet (MetaMask recommended)
- NFT holdings (for full governance participation)
- Node.js environment

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Configure your environment
# Update apps/server/.env with your PostgreSQL and OpenSea API details

# Initialize the database
bun db:push

# Launch the platform
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to access the LOAR platform.
API endpoints available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## 💰 Tokenomics

LOAR implements a sophisticated token economy where narrative influence is directly tied to token holdings and NFT ownership:

- **Voting Power** - Proportional to NFT rarity and token holdings
- **Content Creation Rewards** - Earn tokens by contributing canonical content
- **Governance Participation** - Stake tokens to participate in major narrative decisions

## 🛠️ Development Commands

- `bun build`: Build all applications for production
- `bun dev:web`: Start the frontend dApp only
- `bun dev:server`: Start the blockchain-integrated backend only
- `bun nft:sync`: Synchronize with OpenSea NFT data
- `bun governance:simulate`: Test tokenomics voting mechanisms
- `bun walrus:init`: Initialize decentralized video storage
